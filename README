# lein-release

    How far could you take a jar if the jar was in a tar? Possibly as
    far as Myanmar.

Package your project up as a tarball! 

## Usage

    $ lein release

Creates myproject-1.0.0.tar including everything in pkg/ along with
all dependencies plus the jar of your project. If you are building
from Hudson, your tarball will contain a build.clj file that shows
which build produced it.

## Installation

Add [lein-release "1.1.0"] to your project's :dev-dependencies.
